BMI (Body Mass Index) applies to most adults both women and men over 20. BMI does not tell the body fat directly as it just looks the weight relation to your hight. However, this being said, some researches indicate that BMI correlates to direct measures of body fat similar to underwater weighing and is therefore considered to be an inexpensive alternative for these more advanced and more expensive methods that are also available.
